            <p class="about__text">Formerly Parkfield Xtreme Radio, Ocean Youth was born in 2012. It is a youth-led online radio station and brings young people across Torbay together to make music and radio, build friendships and develop a creative and engaging social action community. Ocean Youth supports Torbay’s young people through helping them to share experiences through broadcasting content on topics such as anxiety, sexual abuse, bullying, addiction, and stress.
